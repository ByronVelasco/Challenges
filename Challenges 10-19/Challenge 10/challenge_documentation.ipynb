    "This approach utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently identify all prime numbers below a given limit. The method begins by assuming all numbers in the range are prime, then iteratively marks the multiples of each discovered prime as non-prime. By the end of the process, only prime numbers remain unmarked, allowing for their sum to be calculated efficiently."

    "A more efficient approach leverages the fact that 2 is the only even prime number. By initializing the sum with 2 and applying the Sieve of Eratosthenes only to odd numbers, memory usage and computation time are significantly reduced. This method marks non-prime odd numbers and accumulates the sum of all primes below the given limit."
