For each generated value, it calculates the total number of divisors by checking all integers up to its square root, counting both the divisor and its complement.

    "## Optimized Triangle Number Search Using Prime Factorization and Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "This method leverages the mathematical properties of triangle numbers and divisor counting to improve efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Triangle Number Formula**: the $n$-th triangle number is given by: $$T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n",
    "  Since $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, they are always coprime (share no common factors except 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Divisor Function Multiplicativity**: for two coprime numbers $a$ and $b$, the number of divisors of their product is the product of their individual divisor counts: $$d(a \\cdot b) = d(a) \\cdot d(b)$$ where $d(x)$ denotes the number of divisors of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficient Factorization**:  \n",
    "\t- If $n$ is even, $T_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (n+1)$.\n",
    "\t- If $n$ is odd, $T_n = n \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{2}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ensures both factors are integers and coprime, allowing the divisor counts to be multiplied directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memoization**:  \n",
    "\tPreviously computed divisor counts are stored and reused to avoid redundant calculations, significantly speeding up the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these properties, the function efficiently finds the smallest triangle number with at least $k$ divisors."
