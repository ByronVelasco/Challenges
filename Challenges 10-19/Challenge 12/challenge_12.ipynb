    "This approach incrementally generates triangle numbers by summing consecutive natural numbers. For each generated value, it calculates the total number of divisors by checking all integers up to its square root, counting both the divisor and its complement. The process continues until a triangle number is found that meets or exceeds the required number of divisors."

    "## **Optimized Triangle Number Search Using Prime Factorization and Memoization**\n",
    "This approach leverages prime factorization to efficiently determine the number of divisors for triangle numbers. By expressing each triangle number as the product of two consecutive integers (with one divided by two), the method calculates the divisor counts of these factors separately and multiplies them to obtain the total. Memoization is used to store previously computed divisor counts, significantly reducing redundant calculations and improving performance compared to brute-force methods."
