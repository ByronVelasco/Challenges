    "This approach systematically explores all possible paths from the top to the bottom of the triangle by representing each decision at every level as a binary choice. It generates every combination of left or right moves for each row, calculates the sum for each resulting path, and identifies the maximum total among all possible routes. This exhaustive search guarantees that the optimal path is found, but it is computationally intensive for larger triangles due to the exponential number of possible paths."

    "## Optimized Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is based on the principle of dynamic programming, which solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. In the context of the triangle path sum problem, the optimal solution for any position in the triangle depends only on the optimal solutions of its two adjacent positions directly below it. By starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, each element is updated to represent the maximum sum obtainable from that position to the base of the triangle. This ensures that, at each step, the subproblem solutions are reused efficiently, and the global optimum is constructed from these local optima. The process guarantees that the value at the top of the triangle represents the maximum total from top to bottom, as it accumulates the best possible choices at each level."
