    "This approach systematically examines every integer from 1 up to a specified limit, generating the Collatz sequence for each number. For each starting value, it repeatedly applies the Collatz rules—halving the number if it is even, or multiplying by three and adding one if it is odd—until reaching 1. The length of each sequence is tracked, and the method identifies the starting number that produces the longest sequence within the given range."

    "\n",
    "This approach leverages memoization to efficiently determine the length of Collatz sequences for large ranges of numbers. By storing previously computed sequence lengths in a dictionary, it avoids redundant calculations for numbers that appear multiple times across different sequences. The method iterates through a subset of numbers, generating their Collatz sequences until reaching a value with a known sequence length, then updates the stored lengths for all encountered values. This significantly reduces computation time compared to recalculating each sequence from scratch."
