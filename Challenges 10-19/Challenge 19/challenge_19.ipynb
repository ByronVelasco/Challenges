    "## **Counting Sundays on the First of the Month by Simulating Calendar Progression**\n",
    "This approach determines the number of Sundays that fall on the first day of each month within a specified date range. It simulates the progression of months and years, accounting for leap years, and tracks the day of the week for the first day of each month. By incrementing a counter whenever the first day is a Sunday, it efficiently computes the desired total."
