    "This approach first checks if the given number is a prime by testing divisibility up to its square root. If the number is not prime, it iteratively searches for the largest factor by decrementing from half of the number. For each candidate factor, it checks if it divides the number evenly and if it is a prime. The process stops when the largest such prime factor is found."

    "This approach efficiently finds the largest prime factor of a number by first removing all factors of 2, ensuring the remaining value is odd. It then iteratively checks for divisibility by odd numbers, starting from 3 and increasing by 2 each time. Whenever a divisor is found, the number is divided by this factor, and the process continues with the reduced value. This eliminates smaller prime factors early and reduces the size of the number to be factored. The process continues until the square of the current factor exceeds the remaining value. If the final value is greater than 1, it is itself a prime and thus the largest prime factor."
