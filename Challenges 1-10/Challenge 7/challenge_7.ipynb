    "## **Prime Number Search Using Square Root Optimization**\n",
    "In previous challenges, we used the fact that 2 is the only even prime number and that any composite number has at least one prime factor less than or equal to its square root. Building on these ideas, we can efficiently identify prime numbers by checking divisibility only up to the square root and skipping even numbers greater than 2. By counting primes in this way, we can find and return the k-th prime number."

    "## **Efficient Prime Search Using the Prime Number Theorem and Sieve of Eratosthenes**\n",
    "This approach estimates an upper bound for the desired prime using the prime number theorem, which relates the distribution of primes to logarithmic functions. It then creates a boolean array representing potential prime candidates up to this bound. Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, it iteratively marks multiples of each found prime as non-prime, efficiently identifying all primes up to the estimated limit. The process continues until the required prime count is reached."
