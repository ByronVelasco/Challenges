    "\n",
    "This approach systematically searches for sets of three positive integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem and sum to a specified value. It does so by iterating through all possible combinations of two numbers within logical bounds, calculating the third value based on the required sum, and checking if the three numbers form a valid right triangle. Valid solutions are collected for further analysis."

    "\n",
    "Euclid's formula provides a systematic way to generate all primitive Pythagorean triplets (those where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coprime):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a = m^2 - n^2,\\quad b = 2mn,\\quad c = m^2 + n^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m > n > 0$, $m$ and $n$ are coprime, and not both odd (i.e., one is even and one is odd).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all Pythagorean triplets with a specific sum $S$, observe that any non-primitive triplet can be obtained by scaling a primitive triplet by a positive integer $k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ka + kb + kc = S\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for each valid pair $(m, n)$, compute the sum of the corresponding primitive triplet and check if it divides $S$ evenly. If so, scaling the primitive triplet by $k = S / (a + b + c)$ yields a triplet whose elements sum to $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that only valid and unique triplets are generated, significantly reducing computational effort compared to brute-force enumeration."
