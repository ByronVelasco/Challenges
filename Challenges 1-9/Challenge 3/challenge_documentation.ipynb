    "\n",
    "To efficiently determine the largest prime factor of a given integer, one can utilize the following mathematical approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, remove all factors of 2 from the number, as 2 is the smallest and only even prime. This ensures that the remaining value is odd, simplifying subsequent steps. After eliminating all factors of 2, proceed to check divisibility by odd numbers, starting from 3 and incrementing by 2 each time. For each odd candidate, if it divides the current value evenly, divide the value by this candidate and continue the process. This stepwise division removes smaller prime factors early, reducing the size of the number to be factored and thus improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process continues until the square of the current candidate exceeds the remaining value. At this point, if the remaining value is greater than 1, it must itself be a prime number and is therefore the largest prime factor. This method is justified because, after removing all smaller prime factors, any remaining factor greater than the square root of the original number must be prime."
