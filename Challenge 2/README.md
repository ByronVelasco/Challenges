# **Challenge 2 â€“ Sum of even Fibonacci's numbers**

In this challenge, the goal is to **sum all the even Fibonacci's numbers** that are less than a specified threshold.

## **Problem Statement**

**Task:**  
Find the sum of all the even Fibonacci's numbers that are **less than `4000000`**.

---

## **Data Context**

- `threshold`: a positive integer number.

Before reading the solutions below, try solving the problem yourself and compare your approach and results.

---

## **Intuitive method**

This method involves computing all Fibonacci's numbers less than the threshold and summing those that are even numbers.

---

## **No conditions method**

Given the first Fibonacci's numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc, we have an even number every three elements. Thus, we do not depend on the **even number** condition.

## **Final Result**

For `threshold = 4000000`, the correct result is:

**4613732**
