    "## Detecting the Longest Recurring Cycle in Decimal Expansions via Long Division Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the length of the recurring cycle in the decimal expansion of a unit fraction $\\frac{1}{d}$, we simulate the process of long division. The key mathematical concept is that the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{d}$ will eventually repeat if $d$ is not a factor of 10. The length of the recurring cycle corresponds to the smallest integer $k$ such that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is equivalent to finding the order of 10 modulo $d$. During long division, if a remainder repeats, the sequence of digits between the first and second occurrence of that remainder forms the recurring cycle. By tracking the position of each remainder, we can compute the length of the cycle as the difference between the positions of the first and second occurrence of the same remainder."
