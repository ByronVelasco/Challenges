    "## **Detecting the Longest Recurring Cycle in Decimal Expansions via Long Division Simulation**\n",
    "The approach involves simulating the process of long division to identify repeating cycles in the decimal representation of unit fractions. For each denominator within a specified range, the method tracks the sequence of remainders that occur as the division progresses. By recording the position at which each remainder first appears, it becomes possible to detect when a remainder repeats, indicating the start of a recurring cycle. The length of the cycle is determined by the difference in positions between the first and subsequent occurrence of the same remainder. By comparing the cycle lengths for all denominators, the one with the longest recurring cycle can be identified."
