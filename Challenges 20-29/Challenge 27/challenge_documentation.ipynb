    "The approach consists of two main steps: first, efficiently determining whether a given number is prime by checking divisibility up to its square root; second, systematically evaluating all possible combinations of coefficients within specified bounds. For each combination, the process counts how many consecutive integer inputs yield prime outputs before encountering a non-prime result. The combination that produces the longest sequence is identified, and its relevant properties are reported."
