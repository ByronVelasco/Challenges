    "\n",
    "The approach involves generating all possible combinations of integer bases and exponents within specified ranges. For each combination, the corresponding power is calculated and stored in a set to ensure uniqueness. After all combinations have been processed, the total number of unique results is determined by counting the elements in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each power can be expressed as $a^n = a \\times a^{n-1}$, we can take advantage of previously computed powers by calculating each new power through multiplication. This approach effectively uses a form of memory, making it more optimal than using the power operator (`**`), especially for larger numbers."
