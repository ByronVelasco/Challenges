    "## **Identifying and Summing Non-Abundant Sums within a Range**\n",
    "This approach involves identifying numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two special numbers, known as abundant numbers, within a specified range. First, all such special numbers up to a given limit are determined. Then, all possible sums of pairs of these numbers are generated and collected. Finally, the approach sums all numbers within the range that cannot be represented as any of these sums, providing the desired result."
