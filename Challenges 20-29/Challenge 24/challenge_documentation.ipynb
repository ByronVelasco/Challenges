    "## Efficient Lexicographic Permutation Selection Without Full Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of *n* distinct elements, the total number of possible permutations is *n!* (n factorial). To determine the element at a specific lexicographic position without generating all permutations, the following principles are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Permutation Blocks**:  \n",
    "\tThe first element of the permutation determines a block of permutations. Each unique first element corresponds to a block of size *(n-1)!*, representing all permutations of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Block Indexing**:  \n",
    "\tTo find the element at a given position, divide the target position (zero-based) by *(n-1)!*. The quotient gives the index of the element to select as the next character in the permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Reduction**:  \n",
    "\tAfter selecting an element, remove it from the set and update the target position to the remainder of the division. Repeat the process with the reduced set and updated position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination**:  \n",
    "\tContinue this process until all elements have been selected, resulting in the desired permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently constructs the permutation corresponding to any lexicographic rank."
