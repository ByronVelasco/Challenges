    "In a square spiral of size $n \\times n$ (where $n$ is odd), the numbers are arranged starting from 1 at the center and spiraling outward in a clockwise direction. Each concentric layer forms a square with an odd side length. For any layer with side length $k$, the four corners of the square can be expressed as:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Top-right corner:} & \\quad k^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Top-left corner:} & \\quad k^2 - (k - 1) \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Bottom-left corner:} & \\quad k^2 - 2(k - 1) \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Bottom-right corner:} & \\quad k^2 - 3(k - 1)\n",
