For example, the name \"COLIN\" is worth $3+15+12+9+14 = 53$, and it is the 938th name in alphabetical order in the list of names. The final score for \"COLIN\" is $938 \\times 53 = 49714$."

    "This approach involves reading the text file, which contains a list of names separated by commas and enclosed in double quotes. It then splits the string by commas and removes the surrounding quotes from each name, resulting in a Python list where each element is a clean name string. To make sure the names are in the same format, they are converted to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, all names are arranged in alphabetical order. For each name, an alphabetical value is calculated by summing the positions of its letters in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.). Each name's score is then determined by multiplying its alphabetical value by its position in the sorted list (starting from 1). The final result is obtained by summing the scores of all names."
