    "The recursive method for computing the factorial of a number is based on the mathematical definition of the factorial function. For any non-negative integer $n$, the factorial is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The iterative method for computing the factorial of a number is grounded in the definition of the factorial as the product of all positive integers up to a given number. For any non-negative integer $n$, the factorial is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This definition naturally leads to an iterative approach, where the result is initialized to $1$ and then successively multiplied by each integer from $2$ up to $n$. This step-by-step accumulation efficiently computes the factorial without recursion, making it well-suited for handling large values of $n$."
