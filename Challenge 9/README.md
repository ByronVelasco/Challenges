# Challenge 9 â€“ Pythagorean Triplet

In this challenge, the goal is to **find a Pythagorean triplet**. A **Pythagorean triplet** is a set of three natural numbers $a<b<c$ such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$.

## Problem Statement

**Task:**  
Find the product of the only Pythagorean triplet for which $a+b+c=1000$

---

## Data Context

- `total`: integer number greater than or equal to 6.

Before reading the solution below, try solving the problem yourself and compare your approach and results.
