    "## **Dynamic Programming Approach for Counting Coin Combinations**\n",
    "The approach uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the number of ways to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations. It initializes a list where each index represents an amount, and the value at each index represents the number of ways to form that amount. For each coin denomination, the method iterates through all possible amounts greater than or equal to the coin's value, updating the list by adding the number of ways to make the current amount minus the coin's value. This ensures that all combinations of coins are considered without repetition, ultimately yielding the total number of ways to form the target amount."
