    "## Dynamic Programming Approach for Counting Coin Combinations\n",
    "The goal is to determine the number of distinct ways to express a target amount as the sum of given coin denominations, where each denomination can be used any number of times. This is a classic problem in combinatorics and can be solved using dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each coin denomination, the number of ways to make a total amount $n$ is calculated by summing the number of ways to make all amounts from $n-c$, where $c$ is the value of the coin. The recurrence relation can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ways}(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{ways}(n - c_i)\n",
