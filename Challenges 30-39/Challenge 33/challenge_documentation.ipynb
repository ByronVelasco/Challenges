    "\n",
    "The methodology systematically examines all possible two-digit proper fractions to identify those where cancelling a common digit from both numerator and denominator produces an equivalent fraction. The approach iterates through all combinations of two-digit numbers (excluding trivial cases ending in zero), converts them to strings for digit manipulation, and checks every possible position where a digit might be cancelled. For each potential cancellation, it verifies whether the original fraction equals the simplified version after removing the common digit. Valid fractions are collected and their product is computed."
