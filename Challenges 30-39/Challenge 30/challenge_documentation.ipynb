    "The problem is based on finding all natural numbers that can be written as the sum of their digits each raised to a fixed power $p$. For a number with $d$ digits, the maximum possible sum of its digits raised to the power $p$ is $d \\times 9^p$, since 9 is the largest possible digit. However, as the number of digits increases, the smallest $d$-digit number, $10^{d-1}$, eventually exceeds the maximum sum $d \\times 9^p$. This creates a natural upper bound for the search: only numbers up to this bound need to be checked.\n",
