    "The objective of this challenge is **to find the total number of triangle words in a given list**. A triangle word is defined as a word whose alphabetical value (sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet) is a triangular number. Recall, a triangle number $T$ is such that $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for some positive integer $n$."
